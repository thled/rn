# rn

rn is a command line tool to rename files and directories.

Its behavior is comparable with that of `mv path/to/old_name path/to/new_name`.  
You can already write this quiet elegant like this `mv path/to/{old_name,new_name}`.
But rn has a more intuitive syntax and is arguably more semantic.

## Requirements

### Development

- [Docker][docker]
- [Docker-Compose][docker-compose]

## Installation

### Download binary

[Archives of precompiled binaries for rn are available.][releases]

### Build binary

1. Clone this repository:

    ```shell
    git clone git@github.com:thled/rn.git
    ```

1. Change to project directory:

    ```shell
    cd rn
    ```

1. Build and start the docker containers:

    ```shell
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

1. Build the app:

    ```shell
    docker-compose exec app cargo build --release
    ```

1. Copy binary:

    ```shell
    cp app/target/release/rn TARGET
    ```

## Usage

`$ ./rn OLD_NAME NEW_NAME`

- OLD\_NAME = the file/directory to rename (possibly with absolute or relative path)
- NEW\_NAME = new name of the file/directory

`$ ./rn --help` for further assistance.

- `$ ./rn foo_file bar_file`
- `$ ./rn path/to/foo_file bar_file`
